##Project  Description :
<p>Name is particularly aimed at solving some of the major issues an army person faces in a base camp. The major solutions we are trying to add in this project are :
1.Providing a system capable of allowing users to communicate using a Bluetooth based mesh network at a time of no cellular network availability.
2.Required person can update information like food, medical facility, etc. and accordingly forward the requests to authorities.
3. Interface for the control room to monitor the soldier’s last position and movement when under network.<p\>
  
##Note:
<p>1.The project is being created as a prototype for Make4thon under the “Defence” track. 
2.Because of limited tech stack and time constraint, we may not be able to add all the features we planned but we will surely work on it after the hackathon.
3.The project requires a mobile application model for its functioning but for the prototype we are creating mobile responsive web app model.<p/>
